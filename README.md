# SSgui
A graphical user interface for Signals and Systems programs provided by professor Carlo Ciulla.

## Inspiration
For the past few weeks I have been taking Signals and Systems as well as some of you, and for every program
that we want to run in this course we have to write a significant line of text on our command prompt. 
I am sure we all have seen something like: `Laplace2019 lightSource139x139-XYpad5.img 139 139 0.5 0.5`.
The problem here, as far as I'm concerned, is that we have to run many programs like this during the semester, and I think
there is a better way to do all this.
## Dependencies
- Python 3.x, you must have python installed in your computer (I am assuming you already have it)
- PySimpleGUI, can be installed by opening cmd (<kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, type `cmd`, hit `Enter`) and passing the command `pip install pysimplegui`
## Suggestions
1. __Use 1 main folder to contain every material that was provided by the professor__ (We will call this folder Signals_and_Systems)
2. __MAKE SURE THAT THE PATH TO THAT FOLDER DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY SPACES OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS__
    - This is essencial to run the program
    - it is advised the path must only contain letters numbers and dashes ( - ) or underlines ( _ )
        - C:\Users\Desktop\Signals and Systems\  is not considered a "good" path. Change it to: C:\Users\Desktop\Signals_and_Systems\

## How to use
1. Download ZIP 
2. Extract ZIP 
    1. Usually, do an "Extract Here"
3. Inside the folder there must me 2 python files and 1 readme file, ignore the readme
4. Open built.py with an editor of your choice (I recommend VS Code but notepad will do fine)
5.
