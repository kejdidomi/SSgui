# SSgui
A graphical user interface for Signals and Systems programs provided by professor Carlo Ciulla.

## Inspiration
For the past few weeks I have been taking Signals and Systems as well as some of you, and for every program
that we want to run in this course we have to write a significant line of text on our command prompt. 
I am sure we all have seen something like: `Laplace2019 lightSource139x139-XYpad5.img 139 139 0.5 0.5`.
The problem here, as far as I'm concerned, is that we have to run many programs like this during the semester, and I think
there is a better way to do all this.
